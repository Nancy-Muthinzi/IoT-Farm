          In 2017, Sh150 billion worth of food went to waste, tossed out or left
          to rot, a report that tries to track food waste has said. According to
          the National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), farmers lost earnings as
          they struggled to manage, store, and transport their produce to the
          market. The growers lost over 1.9 million tonnes of food, even as
          millions of Kenyans grappled with starvation fuelled by debilitating
          drought. <br />

          <!-- Maize, Kenya’s staple food, was the hardest hit, with farmers losing
          Sh29.6 billion to post-harvest wastage, including rodents and poor
          handling. The volume of maize lost during this period - about six
          million bags - is the equivalent of what the country gets from the
          short rains of September to December, experts said. Kenya imported
          maize worth 42 billion, using hard-to-come-by foreign currency to buy
          cereal it could easily produce. -->

          Other produce that went to waste due to poor storage and handling,
          transport, according to the data contained in the 2018 Economic
          Survey, includes Irish potatoes (Sh19.7 billion), milk (Sh12.4
          billion), beans (Sh11.5 billion), bananas (Sh5.6 billion), sweet
          potatoes (Sh3.5 billion), tomatoes (Sh2.4 billion), pineapples (Sh2.4
          billion), sorghum (Sh1.9 billion), and millet (Sh1.6 billion).<br />

          <!-- Every year, the country loses about a third of its produce through
          post-harvest losses and food wastage, explained Timothy Njagi, a
          research fellow at Tegemeo Institute, an agricultural think tank. This
          has an impact on the country’s food security and reduces profitability
          for farmers. The Government has estimated post-harvest losses at 20
          per cent. -->
